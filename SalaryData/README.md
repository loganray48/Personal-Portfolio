## Data Source

The dataset is available on Kaggle: [Salary_Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data?resource=download)

## Data Cleaning and Sampling

The initial steps involve cleaning the dataset and handling data issues. This includes addressing inconsistencies in education-level entries. A random sample of 800 records is then selected for a manageable analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Age vs Salary

The scatter plot above reveals a positive correlation between age and salary. Generally, as individuals age, their salaries tend to increase. Notably, those aged 40 and above typically enjoy substantially higher earnings than their younger counterparts.

### Education Level Distribution

The bar chart showcases the distribution of education levels within a random sample of 4000 individuals. The majority hold a bachelor's degree, with master's and Ph.D. degrees following closely. High school-level education represents the smallest proportion.

### Years of Experience vs Salary

The line chart illustrates the average salary variation based on educational levels and years of experience. A consistent upward trend emerges as experience increases. On average, those with a high school education earn the least, while the highest average salaries alternate among individuals with different educational backgrounds.
